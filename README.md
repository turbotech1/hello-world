# hello-world
Break the ice with github.
Well linux and its power sometimes requires a little bit to get things in place to achieve a reliable and stable
outcome.
It was a long ago that I have used Vnc server to access a linux desktop GUI .
It used to be quite straight forward .
I am going to go through the process to get it running stable on ubuntu linux 18.04 LTS
